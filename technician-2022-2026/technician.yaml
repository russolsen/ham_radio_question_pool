  :question: Why is duty cycle one of the factors used to determine safe RF radiation
    exposure levels?
  :answers:
  - It affects the average exposure to radiation
  - It affects the peak exposure to radiation
  - It takes into account the antenna feed line loss
  - It takes into account the thermal effects of the final amplifier

  :question: What is the definition of duty cycle during the averaging time for RF
    exposure?
  :answers:
  - The difference between the lowest power output and the highest power output of
    a transmitter
  - The difference between the PEP and average power output of a transmitter
  - The percentage of time that a transmitter is transmitting
  - The percentage of time that a transmitter is not transmitting

  :question: How does RF radiation differ from ionizing radiation (radioactivity)?
  :answers:
  - RF radiation does not have sufficient energy to cause chemical changes in cells
    and damage DNA
  - RF radiation can only be detected with an RF dosimeter
  - RF radiation is limited in range to a few feet
  - RF radiation is perfectly safe

  :question: Who is responsible for ensuring that no person is exposed to RF energy
    above the FCC exposure limits?
  :answers:
  - The FCC
  - The station licensee
  - Anyone who is near an antenna
  - The local zoning board
